## Week 1: ML Basics + Pandas

**Focus:**  
- Built foundational intuition about machine learning.
- Learned the basics of supervised learning and predictive modeling.
- Practiced using Pandas for loading, cleaning, and transforming data.
- Completed introductory ML exercises to get comfortable with workflow.
- Worked on predicting house prices as the first assignment.

## Week 2: Neural Networks + PyTorch Basics

**Focus:**  
- Understood how neural networks process data and learn parameters.
- Explored core ideas like perceptrons, activation functions, loss functions, and backpropagation.
- Practiced implementing a basic feedforward neural network for classifying the logical AND gate.
- Got familiar with PyTorch: defining models, specifying loss functions, and running optimizers.
- Reviewed some earlier deep learning assignments to reinforce the basics.

**Checkpoint-1:**  
- Planned assignment to practice scikit-learn and model evaluation.

## Week 3: Deep Learning + CNN + Style Transfer

**Focus:**  
- Went deeper into deep learning principles.
- Learned how convolutional neural networks work and why they are used for images.
- Studied neural style transfer concepts and how to generate stylized images.
- Practiced training a model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Week 4: Neural Style Transfer

**Focus:**  
- Implemented neural style transfer end-to-end using PyTorch.
- Learned how to optimize content and style loss to merge visual styles.
- Explored lightweight implementations to understand how the process can be simplified.
